Sample code from https://github.com/lamberta/html5-animation ported to C++ and SFML.

State: In-Progress.

SFML Version: 2.4.1

Folder Structure:
- chapter#-example#-examplename
	* /Source: Source Code - Visual Studio 2015 Project.
	* Windows Executable x86 File - Static Linked (A double click should be enough to make it work).

Note: If you want to build the Visual Studio Project you may need to change the "Additional Include Directories" and "Additional Library Directories" properties in project settings to match yours. Check the SFML Documentation for more info on how to do this: http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-vc.php.
